# Executors should be variadic

This paper responds to the proposed resolution of an GitHub issue 
[Executors:Issue9](https://github.com/executors/executors/issues/9)
posted 2 years ago relating to the currently proposed 
executor design paper [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443).

## Introduction

The proposed executor interfaces (see [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443)) are to be the fundamental bases 
for implementing parallelism for today's and - more importantly - any future 
application. Thus it is of utmost importance to come up with a design that is 
as flexible as possible and does not impose any limitations on possible future 
use cases.

## Rationale

This paper attempts to provide a rationale for changing the current executor 
design (as outlined in [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443)) such that all execution functions exposed by 
the executors should be variadic instead of them accepting nullary functions. 
The required specification changes are minimal and do not change any of the 
semantics proposed by [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443).

The following sections focus on various aspects and provide arguments in 
favor of exposing variadic execution interfaces for all the proposed types of 
executors. In brief, the current proposal disrupts consistency, inhibits
usability, and prevents runtime information from being passed to the 
executor.


### Consistency with `std::async` and `std::thread`

Well-designed language standards need to be uniform and non-contradictory. 
The definitions of interfaces pertaining to similar 
functionalities should be as consistent as possible.
In C++17 we have three API's related to scheduling and launching of
tasks: `async`, `thread`, and `invoke` (the latter exposing 
a synchronous execution interface). All 
of these functions are specified to accept a variadic set of arguments. 
Requiring all executors to utilize only nullary function objects 
contradicts this fundamental 
requirement of standardization. We claim that the executor interfaces should be 
specified to be variadic - if nothing else - to at least to ensure the consistency 
of the standard.


### Current design inhibits usability

In our opinion, the arguments presented by the
authors of [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) defending the use of 
nullary function interfaces
are not compelling given the cost of usability. 
This section attempts to address some of these concerns and 
provide alternative design choices
that would allow for equivalent functionalities as proposed by 
[P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443), but without the limitation of requiring for the
execution interfaces to require being invoked using nullary functions.

[Executors:Issue9](https://github.com/executors/executors/issues/9))

#### Claim: variadics introduce complexity

> "Separate, variadic bulk analogues of async & invoke make sense to me, but I 
> think they are out of scope for this minimal proposal."

The proposed [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) is everything but minimal at this point. The specification
of variadic execution interfaces would add a very small amount of additional
wording without any change in exposed semantics. Moreover, the specification of 
variadic interface would simplify the specification of some of the APIs. For 
instance, as we will show below, there is no need for special purpose arguments
to be provided to `bulk_execute` and `bulk_twoway_execute` (like the shared 
factories) if the API was specified to be variadic. Removing those would 
simplify the specification and streamline the overall design.

#### Claim: we need bulk interfaces

> "Moreover, I think it's important to reserve additional parameter slots ... 
> for parameters which carry semantics that executors will actually need to 
> customize."

<hr>

> "Finally, I'm concerned variadic parameters would preclude an important 
> additional functionality that bulk executors will want to provide. We envision 
> that a future proposal will want to introduce the ability to create hierarchical 
> executors to support things like GPUs and executors that are composed of a 
> composition of other, more primitive executors."

These quotes refer to special arguments as proposed for the bulk
interfaces, namely factory functions for the generated results etc. We argue
that not only such very specific arguments (like the proposed factory functions)
are limiting the generality of the proposed APIs (as not all bulk executors
might have a need for factory functions or similar), they also unnecessarily leak
implementation details of a limited type of executors to the general users of
those interfaces.

Over-specifying the meaning of certain arguments to be passed to the 
executors inhibit the user's ability to express general use cases, 
especially for those we don't anticipate today.

The special arguments today - and any possible special argument that might
be required in the future - can alternatively easily passed to an underlying 
executor through a modular layered design of wrapping executors.

Here is a small example demonstrating this.
Let's assume, we have a two-way-executor (for simplicity we'll show only the
implementation of a blocking bulk execute implementation, the same
technique can be applied to all other executor APIs). We also assume that it exposes
functionality which is callable through a _variadic_ API:

```
struct two_way_executor
{
    template <typename F, typename ...Ts>
    void bulk_twoway_execute(F && f, size_t n, Ts &&... ts)
    {
        for (size_t i = 0; i != n; ++i)
        {
            invoke(f, i, ts...);
        }
    }
};
```

Now it is trivial to achieve the functionality that is relying on factory
functions for shared data by defining another executor that exposes functionality
similar to `bulk_twoway_execute` as specified by [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) without any special
arguments, completely relying on a variadic bulk execution interface:


```
template <typename Executor, typename RF, typename SF>
struct shared_data_executor
{
    template <typename F, typename ...Ts>
    auto bulk_twoway_execute(F && f, size_t n, Ts &&... ts)
    {
        // implement as needed using the factory functions, while relying on
        // wrapped executor to do the work
        auto shared_results = rf(n);
        auto shared_data = sf();

        // PLEASE NOTE: from the standpoint of 'f' there is no discernible
        // difference to a direct implementation as mandated by P00443
        return exec.bulk_twoway_execute(forward<F>(f), n,
            std::ref(shared_results), std::ref(shared_data),
            forward<Ts>(ts)...);
    }

    Executor exec;
    RF rf;
    SF sf;
};
```

We invoke almost as before:

```
size_t shape = 100;
auto f = [](size_t, auto& shared_results, auto& shared_data) { ... };
auto result_factory = [](size_t n) {...};
auto shared_factory = []() {...};

auto shared_data_exec = 
    shared_data_executor{two_way_executor{}, result_factory, shared_factory};

shared_data_exec.bulk_twoway_execute(f, shape, ...);
```

Please note that from the standpoint of the scheduled function `f` there is
no discernable difference to a direct implementation of the executor as 
mandated by [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) (i.e. compared to using the nullary interfaces).

We do not even need the currently proposed special arguments for the bulk
interfaces, more-so by applying the described implementation techniques we can 
clearly avoid adding more special arguments in the future. Thus the provided
argumentation that we cannot have variadics today because that would prohibit
adding other special arguments in the future is invalid.

By making the executor interfaces 
variadic we open the path for seamless future extensions to the executor 
interface semantics without having to break backwards compatibility.

#### Claim: we have no motivating use case

> "It's also not clear that there is any reason that an executor author would 
> want to customize how variadic parameters get forwarded."

We don't know of any use case for an executor to customize variadic parameter
forwarding either. We will however provide a valid and very important use case
for an executor having to be able to access (read) those parameters for 
performance reasons. We will elaborate on this use case in
[this section](#section_argument_introspection).


### An executor can always package arguments into a nullary object if required

In general, a user shouldn't have to perform tasks like parameter forwarding that
can be applied mechanically and in a general purpose fashion.
In discussions the authors of [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) have explained that the idea would be
to leave the mundane task of wrapping arguments into nullary function objects
to higher level control structures like (a future version of)
`std::async` or `std::invoke`, thus the executors wouldn't have to do that.

We believe, however, that instead of relying on future convenience interfaces
to perform the task of packaging arguments, executors can always perform this
task themselves if an underlying execution context requires this. Not all
executors may even have to perform that task to begin with.

The discussed executor interfaces are fundamental to today's and all future
parallelism library features and many users (and not only library writers) will
use those directly in order to implement their own functionalities. These users
would have to repeatedly write code packaging the arguments of their functions
into nullary objects.

From the standpoint of library developers, the enforcement of nullary function
interfaces will cause unnecessary implementation complexity on things like the
parallel algorithms. Why sprinkle parameter packing/unpacking all over the
place where executors are (directly) used?

Making the executor interfaces nullary requires the use of a lambda which is error
prone (arguments must be forwarded into the capture, must be moved/forwarded
out of the capture when calling the function, and the lambda would have to be
mutable), for instance:

```
template <typename F, typename ... Args>
future<result_of_t<F(Args...)>> foo(F && f, Args && ... args)
{
    return my_exec.twoway_execute(
        [f = forward<F>(f), ...args = forward<Args>(args)]() mutable
        {
             return invoke(forward<F>(f), forward<Args>(args)...);
        });
}
```

Alternatively we would have to introduce a lightweight `bind` helper that moves
its arguments, e.g. something like:


```
template <typename F, typename ... Args>
future<result_of_t<F(Args...)>> foo(F && f, Args && ... args)
{
    return my_exec.twoway_execute(
        deferred_call(forward<F>(f), forward<Args>(args)...)
    );
}
```

All of this increases implementation complexity.

At the same time, with a variadic interface the same function implementation
would just look like:

```
template <typename F, typename ... Args>
future<result_of_t<F(Args...)>> foo(F && f, Args && ... args)
{
    return my_exec.twoway_execute(forward<F>(f), forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```

For these reasons, we propose that making the interfaces variadic adds a small
amount of specification complexity, but massively reduces implementation
complexity of all code that uses executors. The executors themselves would
not necessarily become more complex (`twoway_execute` in the simplest 
blocking case would call `invoke` and could use `thread` if non-blocking,
both of which are already variadic).



### <a name="section_argument_introspection"></a> Executors can't see original arguments (possible performance problem)

On conventional architectures, execution contexts will frequently consist of 
thread pools that are managed by some runtime framework that is responsible for
scheduling of work/tasks as well as other resource management functions.
To optimize performance, users will wish to pass parameters via executors 
to influence task placement, priorities or other arbitrary properties.
The schedulers that must perform the underlying execution of functions/tasks
do not yet (or possibly never will) have a well-defined or standardized API
and it is therefore not yet known what the nature of the parameters required
for scheduling might be. 

Earlier proposals such as [P0113](http://wg21.link/P0113) suggested that 
simple customization of executors (for priority) could be used as follows
```
priority_scheduler sched;
auto low = sched.get_executor(0);
auto high = sched.get_executor(9);
...
async(low, []{ std::cout << "1\n"; });
async(high, []{ std::cout << "9\n"; });
```
and the executor can then forward the `priority` on to the underlying scheduler
during the launching process (this assumes that the executor and scheduler 
have been developed cooperatively and therefore the executor is aware of 
the scheduler capabilities beforehand). 
This approach is well suited to the concept of a model of executors that are 
lightweight, copyable and do not introduce the possibility of races or exceptions
since the executor state is `const` and all tasks created with the executor inherit
the same properties. In this example, all tasks launched using the `low` 
priority executor are treated identically, but differently from all 
tasks launched with the `high` priority executor.

There are use cases that require a more complex type of scheduling that might depend
on the _parameters/arguments of the task_ as well as the task itself. When the argument
values are known at compile time, then the same approach as above may be used, an executor
may be constructed with those values (or some function derived from them) and the
executor is then used directly. 
If the parameters/arguments are not known at compile time, then some property/value
derived from them must be computed at run time and passed through to the scheduler via
the executor interface. 
This breaks the rule that all tasks launched with the executor are treated 
equally and requires the use of a more complex executor and interface.
An example of this is now presented as a motivating example for a variadic 
executor implementation.

### Existing implementation experience

In [HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx) which is a library that 
implements many - if not all - of the existing and proposed standard interfaces
related to concurrency and parallelism (such as the C++17 parallel algorithms 
and the Concurrency TS - ISO/IEC TS 19571:2016)
we have implemented an earlier version of [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) with the extension of making 
the interfaces variadic. We have implemented all of the APIs exposed by HPX 
that require scheduling new tasks on top of our executor implementation (such 
as the implementation of task_block, all of the parallel algorithms, etc.).
These constructs have been used by many users over the last years and have 
proven to be stable, performant, and cross platform. No issues have been 
serious reported. 

We pose this proves that the currently standardized and many of the currently 
proposed standard library features related to parallelism and concurrency can 
be implemented with good success on top of variadic executor interfaces.

# Conclusion

Overall, based on the discussion above we propose changing the currently proposed
executor design as described in [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) to support for
all execution functions to be variadic.

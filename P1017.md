# Executors should be variadic

This paper responds to the proposed resolution of an github issue 
[@Executors16:Issue9] posted 2 years ago relating to the currently proposed 
executor design paper [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443).

## Introduction

## Rationale

### Consistency with `std::async` and `std::thread`

### No reason not to be variadic (usability)

### Executors can't see original arguments (possible performance problem)
